# Organizer

flatMap(Oslo) is organized by Arktekk with the help of other sponsors. 
Arktekk is a small consultancy based in Oslo, Norway.
We are 10 consultants helping people build awesome software using Functional Programming. 
Arktekk free up time for some of its consultants to organize the conference.
It requires a lot of time and dedication.

The purpose of flatMap(Oslo) is to break even. 
As a result there are some financial risks. 
That and liquidity is provided by Arktekk.

As a result Arktekk is able to organize a conference that is tailored for its own consultants.
Which means a function programming conference with focus on Scala and the JVM.
It should be challange and mind expanding.
But above all it should enable the partisipants to create amazing software.

Please talk to any Arktekk consultants before, after or during the conference to give advice, feedback or food for thought.
It is highly appreciated.
