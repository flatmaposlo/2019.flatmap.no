abstract:
   "<p>How can you avoid casting and Options when dealing with inconsistent HTTP APIs? Scala’s path-dependent types provide an elegant solution that is less intimidating than it sounds. Expect to see simple explanations, and the real-world, open-source code that inspired this talk.
   </p>"
description: >
   <p>Consider an HTTP API that responds with different fields based on the type of the input provided. How might you build a type-safe client to interact with this API? Is your code littered with Options? Do you resort to casting?</p>
   
   <p>During this talk, we’ll work through a cleaner, safer solution using Scala’s path-dependent types. Along the way, we’ll learn about related concepts such as abstract type members and dependent method types. While these words might sound intimidating (including to this presenter!), they represent simple concepts useful in solving real-world problems.</p>
