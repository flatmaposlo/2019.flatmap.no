abstract:
  "<p>As a referee I would like to hand out a red card to the traditional Java stack on the foundations of Spring and JPA.</p>
   
  <p>
    Having a functional stack based on simple architecture where the basic Java building blocks are stacked in perfectly enables readability, understandability, speed of development, and agility. 
    It takes functional programming in Java going from map, flatMap, and filter, to a complete architecture. 
    That is important as real applications are more complex than sand castle applications that can be found in blog posts.

  "<p>
    As you first begin to program functionally in Java, you begin to master tools like map, flatMap, and filter, and you think 
  youâ€™re in a better place.
    So what about the rest of the architecture? Here Morten will give you a deep dive into a well build functional java application.
