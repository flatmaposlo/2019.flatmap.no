   <p>Composition is a very central topic in FP, but why is that? Why is everybody so excited about it and how can I use it to make my life easier?</p>
   
   <p>This talk will show why composition is one of THE key aspects of abstractions from FP and why this is so extremely important (and cool) in daily programming</p>
description: >
   <p>You may have heard that “composition” is one of the strengths of FP. But what exactly does that mean and how is that useful?</p>

   <p>This talk will demonstrate how composition in FP can be used to build a larger program/algorithm from small composable parts that “just fit”. We will have a look at a longer case study and slowly build up our program like a lego model with small composable parts.</p>

   <p>After this talk you will have seen why composition really is the key concept in FP and how you can use it to make your life easier. Also, you will gain an appreciation for the beauty of FP and may get the impression that Monads are overrated ;)</p>
