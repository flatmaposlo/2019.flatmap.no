   <p>Property-based testing has been praised in various programming communities, but it can still be hard to see how it applies to your day-to-day work. This talk will describe techniques that you can use to test the “ugly” parts of your system, with case studies from the screencast editor Komposition. </p>
description: >
   <p>Property-based testing has been praised and explored in both functional and object-oriented programming communities. Despite the papers and talks that tell inspiring stories of curious bugs being found by random tests, it can be hard to see how it applies to your day-to-day work. How do you go beyond testing small pure functions? </p>

   <p>This talk will describe techniques that you can use to test the “ugly” parts of your system, and dig deeper into a few case studies from Komposition, a screencast video editor written in Haskell. </p>
