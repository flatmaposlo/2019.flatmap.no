   <p>The SKI combinator calculus can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software. In this talk we’ll use it for live-coding.</p>
description: >
   <p>Ah yes, the lambda calculus!</p> 
   <p>A tremendously expressive language, featuring powerful, high-level concepts such as abstraction! 
   However, it is possible to eliminate such lofty concepts and strip computation down to its bare essentials. 
   The remains can still be thought of and used as a programming language, albeit one that is somewhat more impractical 
   than the high-level lambda calculus we are used to.</p>
   <p>
   As they say, all you need to write a computer program is three symbols and the truth.

  bio: >
    <p>Einar W. Høst is a computer at NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster. His heretic views include thinking before programming and making drawings to understand things better. This arrogant mindset no doubt stems from the idle years spent obtaining a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo.</p>
