   "<p>A transducer is composable algorithmic transformation, but what does that even mean? In the introduction to transducers it’s described as a function with the following signature: <code>(whatever, input -> whatever) -> (whatever, input -> whatever)</code>
   </p>"
description: >
   <p>A function from <code>(whatever, input -> whatever) -> (whatever, input -> whatever)</code> is very vague. In this talk I’ll first explain briefly introduce the reasons why transducers were added to Clojure, ie what problems do they solve. Then I’ll look into what a transducer really is, before I’ll finish up looking at some use-cases for them.

   <p> Erik works as a tech lead at Ardoq, a company in the EA space. He’s a mainly a backend programmer, but tends to work wherever the code is bad enough. Given time he’ll eventually drift into some sort of devops role while trying to figure out how to run the current project even better.

   <p> Lately, he’s been lurking around open-source Clojure projects looking for easy bugs to fix. This is his way of paying back to the community.</p>
