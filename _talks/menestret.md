abstract: >
   <p>Functors are a functional programming central concept… But beyond a buzz word to shine in society, what are they? </p>

   <p>I’ll do my best to give you an intuition about what they are in practice but also about what they are in theory by exploring notions of category theory and how both relate! </p>
description: >
   <p>The gist of my talk is really to make a clear parallel between theory and practice and make both side connect as smoothly as I can! </p>

  bio: >
   <p>I’m a data software engineer and ambassador at Ebiznext, a data centric consulting company in France. I work in Scala since a few years and am an enthusiast functional programming learner. Explaining stuff is both a way to learn myself and to give back to the community what it helped me understand and I take great pleasure to do be as pedagogic as I can !</p>
