   <p>The joy, the agony. Going from something that you love - to something you think will fit your problem area better is not always straightforward.</p>

   <p>Thankfully, the rumours are true. Writing code in purely functional languages tends to produce code that is much easier to read, modify and reason about. But simpler doesn’t mean easy and there are things we’ve had to learn to live without.</p>

   <p>This talk examines how, an experienced functional Scala team, transitioned into writing production code using PureScript and Haskell, as well as the challenges faced along the way.</p>
